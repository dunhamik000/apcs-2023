What I Built:
For my project I built a website called "What's Your Grade?" This website allows you to find what your overall grade will become after a new test or assignment is added. To build this code, I first coded it in java. After, I transfered it to html in order to allow it to become a website. This code takes in your current percentage, the score of the new test/assignment, the points in the section, and the points/percentage of the other sections. It outputs the grade on the assignment/test and your grade in the class before and after the assignment/test is added.

What I Learned:
I have never coded anything in html before or made a website so I learned a lot. I learned how to introduce variables (let), how to collect the information that you asked for, and how to use basic funtions in html. For the java part, I learned how to calculate what your grade will be after something new is added to it. In this project, the java part was fairly easy, it was just very time consuming, but the website part was hard. I had to ask a lot of question about how to code it and ask google for some help with things like making a button. 

How You Can Try It:
    1. Go to: https://dunhamik000.github.io/apcs-2023/ 
    2. Type in the information about your grade
    3. Press enter

Why This Is Cool:
This is cool because you can find out how much you have to get on a test/assignment to maintain or improve your grade. You can use to calm your mind about an upcoming assignment or use it to start mass panicking about a test. For example, someone could use my website for this project to see if they should put this in the test section of their grade or the assignment section. I have already had people asking for my website and had a friend use it to see what grade she needed to get on her final (she discovered that there was no hope for her). This is code that I would have loved having throughout my school carrer and I know other people that care about their grades that would agree. It saves people time rather than having to figure it out on their own.
